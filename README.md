This script retrieves stock data from the Alpha Vantage API, preprocesses the data, and then trains a deep learning model to predict the change in stock price four days into the future. Here's a high-level explanation of each step:

Import libraries: The script imports the necessary libraries, such as alpha_vantage, pandas, and matplotlib.

Retrieve stock data: The script retrieves daily adjusted stock data for a specified symbol (in this case, Apple Inc. with symbol 'AAPL') using the Alpha Vantage API.

Preprocess data: The script creates a new dataframe with the desired columns, adds various columns for day-to-day changes, and removes any rows with missing data.

Prepare the data for the model: The script scales the data, reshapes it into a 3D array, and splits it into training and testing sets.

Define the model: The script defines a deep learning model using the Keras library. The model consists of four LSTM layers, each with 50 units, and three Dropout layers, each with a dropout rate of 0.2. The final layer is a Dense layer with one unit, which outputs the predicted value.

Compile and train the model: The model is compiled using the Huber loss function and the Adam optimizer. It is then trained on the data for 10 epochs with a batch size of 3 and a validation split of 0.3.

Evaluate the model: The script evaluates the model on the test set and prints the test loss. It also plots the actual and predicted values, as well as the training and validation losses over time.

Visualize the activations: The script creates an intermediate model that outputs the activations of all the layers in the original model. It then plots the activations for the first sequence in the test set for each layer.

The purpose of this script is to predict the change in stock price for a given stock four days into the future using a deep learning model trained on historical stock data.
